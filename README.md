# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
The Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) project aims to develop a system that can detect and classify human emotions based solely on speech signals. This technology has wide-ranging applications, from enhancing 
user experience in virtual assistants to monitoring mental health and improving human-computer interaction. The project was motivated by the need for machines to understand and respond to the emotional states 
of users, thereby making interactions more natural and empathetic.

Project Objectives:

Develop a robust model capable of accurately identifying a variety of emotions from speech.
Enhance feature extraction techniques to improve the modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between subtle emotional nuances.
Test and validate the model's performance across different datasets to ensure generalizability.
Integrate the model into potential real-world applications, such as call center analytics, mental health monitoring, and virtual assistants.

Preprocessing Libraries and Tools:

Librosa: A Python library for audio and music analysis, used extensively for tasks like loading audio files, noise reduction, and feature extraction.
SciPy: For signal processing tasks, including filtering and normalization.
Python: The primary programming language for implementing preprocessing scripts.
NumPy and Pandas: For handling and manipulating the extracted feature data, organizing it into structures suitable for machine learning models.
MATLAB: Sometimes used for advanced signal processing and feature extraction tasks.
Scikit-learn: A Python library that provides simple and efficient tools for traditional machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests.

Model Evaluation Technologies:

Matplotlib and Seaborn: Python libraries used for visualizing the performance of models, such as plotting confusion matrices and ROC curves.
Scikit-learn Metrics: Provides tools for calculating accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and other evaluation metrics.

The Speech Emotion Recognition project achieved significant advancements in accurately detecting emotions from speech. The deep learning-based models, particularly the CNN-LSTM hybrid, demonstrated 
strong performance and potential for real-world applications. Future work will focus on enhancing the model's robustness, expanding its applicability, and exploring multimodal emotion recognition to further
bridge the gap between human and machine communication.
